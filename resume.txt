Luke has over 10 years of experience building innovative and crafty software for customers and for his teams.  From cellular networks to anti-spam to appliances and social software, Luke has grown codebases and organicly lead teams towards a reflective, trustful, agile practice. 

Most recently, I've been working at Socialtext as one of the core developers.  I'm proud both of what we built and also how we built it.  I learned a tremendous amount while working with a very talented team.

- Guided our globally decentralized engineering team through major transitions
- Built an innovative culture through monthly open R&D "Wiki Wednesday" days
- Built a dev practice that used agile, lean, kanban, retrospectives
- Migrated a legacy webapp codebase into modern code and real-time architecture
  without any major business interruptions, in a small memory footprint.
- Stood on the shoulders of giants to build an awesome REST API.
- Technically: Years of Modern Perl, Javascript, Async, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Git

When I'm not writing code for Socialtext, I've been writing code for citizens.  I co-created an award winning Open Data application called VanTrash.ca.  Built on the simple idea of helping people remember garbage day, it demonstrated a model for citizen and government co-collaboration.  Since then, I've co-founded a service called Recollect.net which gives citizens a more useful and modern interface into a civic service and enables municipalities to better communicate to it's citizens.

I also maintain many open source libraries and tools on github.com/lukec.  I co-created and maintained the Perl driver for the Selenium project.
