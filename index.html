                        <h2>Background</h2>
                                <p>I have over 10 years of experience building
                                innovative and crafty software products and
                                tools.  Social software, collaboration tools,
                                cellular network protocols, anti-spam gateways
                                and virtual appliances, I've grown codebases
                                and organically lead teams towards a
                                reflective, trustful, agile practice. </p>
                                <br />

                                <p>Most recently, I've been working at <a
                                    href="http://socialtext.com">Socialtext</a>
                                as a core developer. Some of my
                                accomplishments there are:</p>
                                <br />

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Guided our globally decentralized
                                    engineering team through major
                                    transitions.</li>
                                    <li>Built an innovative and trusting dev culture through
                                    monthly open R &amp; D "Wiki Wednesdays",
                                    agile processes and retrospectives.</li>
                                    <li>Migrated a legacy webapp codebase into
                                    modern code and real-time
                                    architecture without any major business
                                    interruptions, keeping a small memory
                                    footprint.</li>
                                    <li>Stood on the shoulders of giants to
                                    build <a
                                        href="http://www.socialtext.com/blog/2010/07/socialtext-connect-bringing-open-web-standards-behind-the-enterprise-firewall/">awesome
                                        HTTP APIs</a>, used by our team
                                    and our customers.</li>
                                    <li>Used many tools including Modern Perl,
                                    Javascript, Async Programming, Solr, Nginx, PostgreSQL, and Git.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br />

                                <p>Outside of work, I have been building
                                software for citizens.  I co-created an award
                                winning Open Data application called <a
                                    href="http://vantrash.ca">VanTrash</a>.
                                Built on the simple idea of helping people
                                remember garbage day, it demonstrated a model
                                for citizen and government co-collaboration.
                                Since then, I've co-founded a service called
                                <a href="http://recollect.net">Recollect</a>
                                which gives citizens a more useful and modern
                                interface into a civic service and enables
                                municipalities to better communicate to it's
                                citizens.</p>
                                <br />

                                <p>In between all of this, I have co-founded
                                the <a href="http://hackspace.ca">Vancouver
                                    Hack Space</a> and learned a great deal
                                about DIY electronics and 3d printers.</p>

			<h2>Relevant Skills</h2>
                        <p>I have extensive experience developing products in
                        several areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designing, building and maintaining HTTP, Webhook, and Real-time APIs.</li>
                            <li>Analyzing, testing and solving performance and
                            scalability goals and problems.</li>
                            <li>Creating actionable plans of investigation and
                            execution, then working with teams to
                            transparently accomplish them.</li>
                            <li>Automating business and development
                            processes to improve company efficiency.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <p>I have mainly developed products using the following
                        technologies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Internet</strong> - I started in Data
                            Communications and the Internet has been a huge
                            part of my life and career. I strongly believe in
                            URIs, HTTP, RESTful APIs and in the open web.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unix</strong> - I have been working
                            with various unixes for my entire career. I am
                            very comfortable at the command line and with unix
                            architectures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Perl</strong> - I've seen The Good, The
                            Bad and The Ugly of Perl code.  But along with
                            CPAN, Perl has helped me build valuable tools with
                            fast development times, good performance and low
                            memory footprints.</li>
                            <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> - I have used
                            PostgreSQL 7, 8 and 9 and built systems for
                            quick and reliable schema patching, long term
                            OLAP-style data retention, and traditional
                            RDBMS.</li>
                            <li><strong>Remote Deployments</strong> - I have
                            been involved in building several real and virtual
                            appliances for behind-the-firewall deployment. I
                            have deep experience designing and building
                            deployment and update systems.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <p>When I build products, I rely on my soft skills:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Careful listening</strong> skills lead to deep
                            understanding of what is being said</li>
                            <li><strong>Pragmatic approach</strong> to balancing customer and
                            engineering needs</li>
                            <li><strong>At ease talking</strong>, presenting ideas, leading
                            design sessions</li>
                            <li><strong>Open minded</strong>, creative approach to solving
                            problems</li>
                            <li><strong>Speaker</strong> at OSCON, YAPC::NA, Vancouver Agile
                            Conference, others</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <p>I have gained various levels of competence with
                        many other technologies, such as:</p>
                        <ul><li>Javascript, Solr, Nginx, Python, Bash, PHP,
                            Haskell, O'Caml, Vim, Screen, …</li></ul>
                        <br />
                        <p>And I have many other <a
                            href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9BbL2G_wMI">irrelevant
                            skills</a> and can grow a mean unix beard.</p>
